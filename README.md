As a business student studying cybersecurity, I wanted to do a quick data analysis of the top 100 companies in 2022. Specifically the revenue numbers.
I wanted to see how the pandemic was still affecting the countries top companies 1-2 years later. Which companies flourished and which ones took a hit. 
I picked out a dataset that gave me the Name, Industry, Revenue (in millions), Revenue Growth Percentage, Number of Employees and where their Headquarters are located.
With this information I wanted to ask a few questions to try and understand which companies were profiting and doing well post-pandemic. 
The questions i asked were, What are the top 5 companies by revenue in 2022 in the United States?
Which industry appears at the top and bottom of the list?
Which state/city hosts the most/least of the top 100?
Which companies have a lower employee base (below 100,000)?
Which companies have a higher employee base(above 500,000)?
Which company had the highest revenue growth percentage in 2022?
and finally, which company had the lowest revenue growth percentage in 2022?
Through my analysis I found that New York hosted the most top 100 companies at 13.
Yet, the highest revenue company is Walmart who is headquartered in Arkansas.
Another interesting fact was that the Industry that appeared the most were Financial Industries.
Yet, the lowest revenue growth percentage belonged to Bank of America at 0.10% but was number 36 overall in Revenue.
As mentioned previously, Walmart held the top spot in 2022 at 572 million in revenue but the growth percentage was at a low 2.40%
This makes sense given at that time the country was recovering from being shutdown and limiting person-to-person contact which closed many stores.
Another interestng but not surprising fact from this analysis, Pfizer was the top company in Revenue growth percentage at an astounding 94%
Much higher than Walmart but overall revenue clocked in at 81 million and a rank of 43.
Given the need for a vaccine and the number of cases that occured due to the pandemic, this growth was expected albeit total revenue was lower than almost half of the top 100.
Through my analysis, I was not surprised to see even retail stores muddying the waters and maintaining a top spot.
Financial institutions did interest me on how they were the most represented industry given many people may have lost their jobs during this time and the economy taking a big hit.
Pfizer being the highest growth company was not surprising but the percentage at which it grew was highly impressive.
